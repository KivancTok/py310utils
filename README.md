Getting Started

Now that you typed the import statement, let's continue on!

### Method `replace_from_list`
To use it, copy this field:
```python
import py310utils

py310utils.replacements.replace_from_list(["a", "b", "c"], ["d", "e", "f"], "abc")
```

## `py310utils.elements`

### Module `atomcreator`

### Function `create_atom`

To use it, it wil ask you these things:
1. What is the name of the atom? (e.g. "Axon")
2. What is the abbreviated name of the atom? (e.g. "Ax")
3. What is the atomic number of the atom? (e.g. 119)
4. How many types are there for the atom? (e.g. 2)
5. What is the atomic mass of the first type? (e.g. 316)
6. What is the chance of occurence of the first type (in percents)? (e.g. 50)

I won't really write much more, since I'm tired of writing this.
